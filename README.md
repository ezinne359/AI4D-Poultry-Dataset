# Improving Livestock Health with Deep Learning: a benchmark study

This code base contains the code used to preprocess images taken at 34 poultry farms in Tanzania. We have four classes: healthy, cocci, newcastle, and salmonella. We include code for three main computer vision tasks: 

\begin{itemize} 
	\item Object Detection 
	\item Segmentation 
	\item Image Classification
\end{itemize}
